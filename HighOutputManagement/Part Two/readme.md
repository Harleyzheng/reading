## Managerial Leverage

Activities (hours invested, products planned, meetings had...etc) are not outputs (what we achieved).

Types of activities:

- information gathering. It's the basis of all other activities. Most useful information comes from quick, casual verbal exchanges. Yet written reports are more a medium of *self-discipline* than a way to communicate. The preparation of an annual plan is in itself the end. **It's the soul-searching, the mental exercise and missed things catching that is valuable, not the formal report itself.**
- nudge. Advocating a preferred course of action, but not issuing an instruction or command (or firm, clear directives).
- decision making
- being a role model. Actions convey a manager's own sets of values. *How you handle your own time is the single most important aspect of being a role model.*
- meeting is a medium through which you can do all activities. You must choose **the most effective medium for what you want to accomplish.**

## Leverage of Managerial Activity

Managerial output = a1 x L1 + a2 x L2 + ...  (a is activity, L is leverage of the activity)

To increase managerial productivity, 

1. Increase the rate of performing activities
2. Increase the leverage associated with various activites
3. Shifting activities from lower to those with higher leverage

### High leverage activities

1. When many people are affected by one manager. 
2. When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of words or actions. 
3. When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information.

Examples: 

- Spending some time in the planning process to eliminate confusion and ambiguity.
- When a valued employee has decided to quit. **Timeliness** is critical.
- Lack of preparation of a meeting reduce the output.
- Orientation course. Training.
- Performance review. Affecting another person's performance over a long time at a cost of few hours.
- When a manager becomes depressed. Depression immediately spread throughout the org.
- Waffling - puts off a decision. No green light is a red light.
- Managerial meddling. It stems from a supervisor exploiting too much superior work knowledge. The employee will begin to take a much more restricted view of what's expected of him, showing less initiative in solving his own problems and referring them to his manager.
- Paying close attention to customer complaints.

### Delegation as Leverage

Be **conscious** of managerial meddling - *when I give you a pencil, and when you come to take it, I won't let go.* It's okay to not let go something you enjoy doing, as long as it's a conscious decision.

**Delegation without follow-through is abdication**. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result. 

Monitoring should be done at lower-cost stages possible, and should apply the concept of **variable inspection**, i.e. adjusting the frequency of monitoring and monitor details randomly. For example, at Intel, we ask a subordinate to think through the entire matter carefully before presenting a request for approval. And to monitor how good his thinking is, we ask him quite specific questions about his request during a review meeting. If he answers them convincingly, we’ll approve what he wants.

### Other production principles to increase output.

- **carry a inventory of projects that the manager can work on to increase the team's productivity over the long term**. Without such an inventory of projects, a manager will most probably use his free time meddling in his subordinates’ work.
- be more consistent, use a specific method that has been shown to work before.
- batching similar tasks
- actively use your calendar, taking the initiative to fill the holes between the time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities.
- say no to work beyond your capacity to handle. say no earlier than later.
- allow slack in scheduling.

### How many subordinates should a manager have

Rule of thumb: 6 to 8. Allocate about a half day per week to each subordinate. More than that: managerial meddling. Less than that: not enough opportunity for monitoring

### Handle Interruptions

Understand that people who interrupt have legitimate reasons. 

Solutions: Prepare standard responses. Delegation. Batching questions at scheduled times or open office hours. A manager can hang a sign on his door that says, “I am doing individual work. Please don’t interrupt me unless it really can’t wait until 2:00.”

A bad solution is to hide physically.

## Meetings

meetings have a bad name (被妖魔化了).

A meeting is nothing less than the *medium* through which managerial work is performed:

1. supply information and know-how, and to impart a sense of the preferred method of handling things to the groups under his control and influence. 
2. A manager also makes and helps to make decisions. 

### Process-Oriented Meetings

Regular meetings where knowledge and information are shared.

**One-on-ones**

主要聊performance。

交换信息，manager围绕下属的疑惑点给出建议，指导如何面对和解决问题。同时，下属把他们观察到的信息告诉manager。

建立一个process（或者氛围）鼓励分享personal的问题，不然会在meeting最后突然surprise manager，而且时间不够了。

当所有问题都讨论完后，可以问一个“还有别的问题吗？“，来得到下属真正都想法。

manager的一个小时换来下属80个小时更高质量的产出，同时强化他们的想法。

可以准备一个note，准备每次会议讨论内容的大纲，记录每个dicision，记录的行为就是一个承诺，证明下属会去改变。This applies the principles of batching - avoid ad-hoc meetings.

one on ones can be scheduled on a rolling basis to allow flexibilities.

**Staff Meeting （team meeting）**

主要讨论任何关于两个人以上的事情。

可以有两个部分，第一部分是有个提前的agenda给参与者，让他们能准备想法。第二部分是自由讨论，用来讨论任何事请。

In a team meeting, the supervisor is a leader, observer, expediter, questioner, decision maker, **but not a lecturer. Most importantly, the supervisor is a meetings moderator.**

对于ad-hoc meeting，如果可以call off at a low-value stage，就能节省很多cost。ad-hoc meeting的数量如果很多，说明平时的regular meeting 的process需要被提高。

## Decisions, Decisions

3 个 phase。Free Discussion → clear decision → full support (if wrong go back to 1)

### **Free Discussion**

Usually when a meeting gets heated, participants hang back, trying to sense the direction of things, saying nothing until they see what view is likely to prevail. Then they throw their support behind that view to avoid being associated with a losing position. 

**All it produces is bad decisions. Because if knowledge people withhold opinions, final decisions are less complete.**

### **Decision**

Decision needs to be worked out with people with both qualities, reliance on technical knowledge, and judgment developed through experience and learning from many errors one has made.

Problem: During discussion, everyone sit back and wait for a consensus to develop, before risk taking a position.

**Self-Confidence**. gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision. or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled.

**Sounding dumb**. each time an insight is withheld, an appropriate question is suppressed, the decision-making process is less good than it might have been. 

### Full Support

People can't agreeing with one another at all times. But it's important to have people's commitment to support honestly. 

### Other Concerns

Realization that the problem of knowledge people not comfortable with purely position powered managers. Similarly, managers holding position power don't know what to do because they realize they don't know enough about the technical details to arrive at the correct decision. 

And a cliché: decision-making is hard!
