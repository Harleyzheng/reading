# Part Three. Team of Teams

### **Centralization-Decentralization Dichotomy**

What does this big word mean? As a company grows into a national one, do we want to make decisions nationally or locally? Decisions can be quite complex:  advertising, supply chain, hiring, production machines, quality control, real estate, menu, furnitures etc.

### Hybrid Organizations

We are introducing two organization forms, mission-oriented or functional. 

- A mission-oriented form org is completely decentralized.  Each individual business unit pursues mission with little tie-in to others.
- A functional form org is the other extreme, i.e. completely centralized. Functional departments are responsible for all locations/branches.

Finding the balance between the two extremes can help us get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage. Functional teams provide centralized and scalable resources. Therefore they provide high leverage to the company. In the meantime they need to solve the problem of scalability and tackle bottlenecks when user growth is high. 

Mission oriented teams only have one meaningful purpose - responsiveness. They can respond to changes in demands because of closer proximity. 

> all large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid form

How to find the right balance? The answer lies with middle managers who work in the first line to generate internal resources and consume those resources. They need to develop and master the practice through which a hybrid org can be managed. This is dual reporting. 

### Dual Reporting

Matrix management was invented by NASA by accident. The core idea is that somebody outside of the team could wield as much influence as could the team itself. The team is mission oriented, and the outside person or group (who's usually a technical supervisory representing functional form of the org) is functional. 

For example, the hiring committee of a company is a functional team. During a candidate's hiring process, they provide uniform standards as well as highly specialized knowledge to aid decision making. 

This is dual reporting. It combines the best of mission oriented form and functional form. It requires voluntary surrender of individual decision making to the group. This why trust is so important in an organization's culture.  

### Modes of Control

How to control the behavior and motivate teams and individuals? 

There are 3 means of control: 

- free market forces (clearly defined dollar value)
- contractual obligations (work contract)
- cultural values (interest of the larger group takes precedence over the interest of the individual. again why trust is important)

To find the most appropriate mode of control. There's another factor called CUA factor. It stands for complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity. 

1. When self-interest is high, CUA factor is low, free market forces is the best mode. 
2. When self-interest is low, CUA factor is low, contractual obligation is the best mode.
3. When self-interest is low, CUA factor is high, cultural values is the best mode.
4. When self-interest is high, CUA factor is high, NOTHING WORKS!

Take the example of driving. 1 is when you buy a car and new equipments. 2 is when you stopped at a red light. 3 is when you help out someone at highway. And 4 is like a sinking ship, nothing will help.

Let's look at another example. When a new grad joins, their motivation base on self interest. And we should give them well structured job with low CUA factor. If he does well, he will begin to feel more at home, worry less about himself, and start to care more about his team. 

Early employees of Apple and Intel could have left the company and immediately paid by much higher salaries. They stayed because they believe in the company and had faith in the future. This is an example of cultural value.
