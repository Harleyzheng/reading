# Elicit Peak Individual Performance like a Sports Player

### Motivation

When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons: The person either can't do it or won't do it. Either not capable, or not motivated. 

How does a manager elicit peak individual performance?

Through **training** and **motivation**. Better motivation means better performance, when applying the same amount of training. 

In industrial revolution, motivation is based on fear of punishment. However, this won't work for, say, computer architects because knowledge workers' output is not easily measurable. 

If we are to create and maintain a high degree of motivation, we must keep some needs unsatisfied at all times. 

### Andrew Maslow's definition of needs (therefore motivation and performance).

When a lower need is satisfied, one higher is likely to take over.

Self-Actualization

Esteem/Recognization

Social/Affiliation

Safety

Physiological

Esteem/Recognization is self-limiting. That is, when a need is satisfied, it can no longer motivate a person. 

**Self-Actualization**. The needs to achieve one's utter personal best in a chosen field of endeavor. Once someone's source of motivation is self-actualization, his drive to perform has no limit. Achievement driven. An abstract need to achieve in all that they do. Competence driven. Spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities. 

Cultivate achievement driven motivation. 

Goal setting for peak performance. An object should be set at a point high enough so that even if the individual pushes himself hard, he will still only have a fifty-fifty chance of making them.

**Money**. For low level of motivation hierarchy, money itself will motivate people. Absolute lump sum matters. For higher level, money itself is not a source of motivation, be a measurement of achievement, which will motivate without limit. How it compares against what other people got matters.

**In self-actualization mode, the most important type of measure is feedback on his performance. For a self-actualized person driven to improve his competence, the feedback lies within the individual himself.**  

In physiological need-dominated mode, fear from something outside drives people. In self-actualization mode, fear is coming from inside.

### **The sports analogy - turning the workspace into sports field can turn employees into athletes.**

Managers' role is to train subordinates and bring them to the level of self actualization where their motivation becomes self-sustaining and limitless. 

How to lead people to self-actualization? A race track, an arena of competition, establishment of rules of games. 

To try to do this, we must overcome cultural prejudice, evil image of "workaholics". 

Comparing our work to sports also teaches us how to cope with failure. 

 

### **Task Relevant Maturity**

**low**: structured; task-oriented; tell "what", "when", "how"

**medium**: communication, support, mutual reasoning

**high**: minimal manager involvement; establish objectives and monitoring

From low to high TRM, motivation comes from outside to within. 

### **Performance Review**

purpose should be: to improve the subordinate's performance. 

Assessing Performance: 

**Present value vs future value.** 

**Commitment of action** is important. People do not need to side with you; you only need them to commit themselves to pursue a course of action that has been decided upon. "Look, I understand that you don't consider it worth your time to do it. But I want you to do it."

**Reviewing the Ace** improving the performance of our stars is a high leverage activity. 

### **Interviewing**

Candidate should talk most of the time.

Ask self-assessment questions. "How good are you technically?"

Ask a candidate to handle a hypothetical situation

Candidate can tell you a great deal about his capabilities, skills and values by asking you questions.

### Handling "I Quit"

Almost in all cases, the employee feels they are not important to you.

Drop what you are doing. Sit him down and ask why he's quitting. Let him talk-don't argue about anything with him. After he's finished going through all his reasons for leaving, ask him more questions. Because after the prepared points are delivered, the real issues may come out.

Mindset: you own it to your employer to save a valuable employee. The good of the company is more than keeping one valued employee. Other employees respect him; and if they are like him, they identify with him.
